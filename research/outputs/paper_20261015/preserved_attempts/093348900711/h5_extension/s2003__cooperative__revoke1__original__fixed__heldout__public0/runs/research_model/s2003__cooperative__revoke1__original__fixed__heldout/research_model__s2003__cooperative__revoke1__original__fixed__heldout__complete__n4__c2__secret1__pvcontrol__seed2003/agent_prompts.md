### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.

[2] Robin: Hello all, I am evaluating the medium priority documentation tasks. I have strong documentation skill with low cost on ISSUE-0001::triage (1.69) and am considering claiming it. Anyone interested in other tasks from ISSUE-0001 or ISSUE-0002? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Ernest: Hello all, I have strong documentation skills with a good cost for REVIEW or DOCS tasks from ISSUE-0001 or ISSUE-0002. I see Robin is interested in ISSUE-0001::triage, which I think is a good choice. I am considering REVIEW or DOCS from either issue to avoid overlap. Anyone else interested in these or other tasks? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Milissa: Hello Robin and Ernest, I see Robin is considering ISSUE-0001::triage and Ernest is looking at REVIEW or DOCS tasks from ISSUE-0001 or ISSUE-0002. I have a strong documentation skill and my lowest cost is for ISSUE-0001::triage but since Robin is interested, I will consider other tasks. I am interested in ISSUE-0001::review or ISSUE-0001::docs if no conflicts. Anyone else interested in those or ISSUE-0002 tasks? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[5] Milissa: Hello all, I am Milissa. I am looking at medium priority documentation tasks with my top skill in documentation. I see Robin interested in ISSUE-0001::triage and Ernest in REVIEW or DOCS for ISSUE-0001 or ISSUE-0002. I want to avoid conflicts and coordinate. I prefer ISSUE-0001::review or ISSUE-0001::docs unless someone else claims them. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[6] Milissa: Follow-up: I can handle either ISSUE-0001::review or ISSUE-0001::docs. If anyone prefers one over the other, please let me know to avoid duplication. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[7] Jonie: Hello Robin, Ernest, and Milissa. I see strong interest in ISSUE-0001 triage, review, and docs tasks. I have 4.0 hours available with top skill in documentation and lowest cost on ISSUE-0001::triage (1.91) but Robin seems focused there. I am also considering ISSUE-0001::docs or review if others prefer triage. I prefer to avoid conflicts and will defer to you on your preferences for review vs docs on ISSUE-0001. Let's coordinate so we cover the most tasks efficiently. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[8] Jonie: I am Jonie. I am available for medium priority documentation tasks, especially ISSUE-0001 docs or review if those are still open. Please share your preferences so we can allocate efficiently and avoid duplicates. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[9] Jonie: Reminder to team: I am Jonie, available for ISSUE-0001 documentation review or docs tasks given my top skill in documentation and cost considerations. I defer to Milissa and Ernest on their preferences between these tasks to avoid overlap. Let's aim for maximum coverage with minimum duplication. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[10] Robin: Hello team, I see strong interest in ISSUE-0001 tasks. I plan to claim ISSUE-0001::triage given my low cost and skill match. Ernest, Milissa, Jonie, please coordinate on review and docs tasks to avoid overlap. Let's cover as many tasks as possible efficiently. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[11] Robin: Following up: Milissa and Jonie, please share your preferences on ISSUE-0001 review vs docs tasks so we can allocate tasks efficiently without overlap. Ernest, any preference between ISSUE-0001 and ISSUE-0002 review or docs tasks? Let's finalize our assignments soon. (phase=planning, iter=1)

Blackboard 1:
[1] [context] JIRA sprint task allocation. Each agent chooses at most one micro-task (or skips). Maximize tasks completed, prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost. Avoid duplicate task selections and infeasible assignments.

Participants: Robin, Ernest
[2] Robin: Ernest, I see you are also on this channel. Do you plan to take any documentation tasks from ISSUE-0001 or ISSUE-0002? I am leaning towards ISSUE-0001::triage due to cost and skill match. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Ernest: Robin, I agree ISSUE-0001::triage seems a good pick for you given your cost and skill. I am considering ISSUE-0001::review or docs tasks to avoid conflict and optimize coverage. Let me know if you prefer otherwise. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Robin: Ernest, I am leaning towards ISSUE-0001::triage due to cost and skill match. Please focus on review or docs tasks from ISSUE-0001 or ISSUE-0002 to avoid conflicts. Let me know your preference. (phase=planning, iter=1)

=== CURRENT PHASE: PLANNING ===
Coordinate via blackboards. Decide which tasks to claim in execution.
